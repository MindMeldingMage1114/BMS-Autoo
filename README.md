Movie Ticket Checker with Twilio Notifications
Automate the process of checking movie ticket availability on BookMyShow using this JavaScript project. The script, powered by Puppeteer for web scraping and Twilio for SMS notifications, continuously monitors a specified URL, providing real-time updates on ticket availability. The dynamic while-loop ensures timely checks, and the code, available on GitHub, demonstrates proficiency in web automation, API integration, and error handling.
